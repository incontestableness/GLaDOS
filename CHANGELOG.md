# GLaDOS Changelog

## [3.1.0] - 2021-07-04
### First "stable" alpha release
+ Dynamic configuration options
+ Soft restart support to preserve API data when restarting GLaDOS for development and maintenance
+ Removed API ratelimits
+ Reduced API cache times, ultimately down to 5 seconds
+ Added `getnames.py` for viewing potential bot names from the API and detecting evasion characters in bot names

+ Implemented detection of namestealing bots
+ Improved server scanning performance, ultimately making scans take less than 5 seconds
+ Implemented fully automatic bot name detection with automatic blacklisting and improved bot name matching

+ Added HTTPS support to the website and the GLaDOS API

+ Created a multithreaded and asynchronous program (`ketchupbottle.py`) based on `zeolite.py` to find Valve servers not reported by the `ISteamApps/GetServersAtAddress` Steam API
+ Rewrote GLaDOS to use the much more reliable `IGameServersService/GetServerList` Steam API, deprecating the three previous methods of host discovery (thanks to Makamoto from teamwork.tf for the info!)

+ Increased reliability of data persistence by autosaving periodically
+ Restructured the GLaDOS source code to be more readable and maintainable
+ Enhanced debug logging, including better control via the `settings.ini` file
+ Repeated improvements to several of the GLaDOS API calls, including new features and better human readability/useability

+ Created the `valve_whitelist.py` module to dynamically generate a set of CIDR ranges comprising datacenters in Valve's `NetworkDatagramConfig.json` and Valve's ASN
+ Implemented Valve IP/port whitelist validation for the `/check/<server>` API

+ Finally implemented bot name variant tracking and multi-pattern matching in the `/namerules` API
  + This allows GLaDOS to manage bot names with invisible unicode characters and the like as well as for the rules to detect them reliably
+ Finally implemented asynchronous server scanning, making scans even faster than before
  + Added dynamic times seen requirements based on scan frequency, to ensure namerules accuracy
  + Added a scan frequency stabilizer to prevent GLaDOS from scanning too often
+ Fixed issues with namerules regex not being created correctly
+ Restructured the codebase (again) to tidy things up
+ Way too many bug fixes and miscellaneous improvements to list

## [3.0.0] - 2021-04-19
### Initial alpha release
+ Basic support for running as a WSGI application
+ Basic support for scanning servers in lists generated by `potato.py`
+ Detection of malicious bots based on manually defined regex patterns in `name_blacklist.txt`
+ `/popmaps/<desired_region>` API for seeing which maps malicious bots have recently been seen on
+ `/botnames` API for seeing potential malicious bot names
+ `/check/<server>` API for retrieving the number of detected malicious bots on any given server
